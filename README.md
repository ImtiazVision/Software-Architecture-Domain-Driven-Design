# Software-Architecture-Domain-Driven-Design

**Domain-Driven Design** existed prior to agile and microservices. However, the overall design is excellent and remains relevant today. 

**Domain-Driven Design** has the following characteristics :

1. **Collaborative** : Throughout the project, business executives and developers must collaborate on a daily basis.

2. **Modeling** : Domain-Driven Design is built on the notion of modeling that is the structure of the code models one-to-one to the domain structure. By glancing at the overall code, all collaborators can understand the structure of the code, and when changes are made inside the domain, we will know exactly where to look at the code due to the one-to-one mapping between code and domain.
